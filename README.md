### Data from Allen Institute converted to NeuroML

Example files to test interaction between models developed at the Allen Brain Institute and NeuroML.

#### Allen CellTypes Database
 
Data and models from the [Allen CellTypes Database](http://celltypes.brain-map.org/) has been used to 
construct NeuroML based models. See https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/AllenInstituteNeuroML/tree/master/CellTypesDatabase.

#### DiPDE interactions

There are some initial ideas for interactions between [DiPDE](http://alleninstitute.github.io/dipde/) and 
NeuroML 2 [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/AllenInstituteNeuroML/tree/master/DiPDE).
