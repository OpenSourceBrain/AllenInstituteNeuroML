A directory for examples of interactions between [DiPDE](http://alleninstitute.github.io/dipde/) and NeuroML 2.

Currently there is no way to express **population based models** in general in NeuroML2 (and therefore DiPDE models)
but we are exploring the possibility to export the structure of the populations, connections, etc. to NeuroML 
for visualisation in the OSB 3D explorer.
