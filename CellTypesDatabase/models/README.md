## Models based on Allen Cell Types Database data

### NEURON models

A number of NEURON models which have been generated by the Allen Institute from their data can be found in [483108201/](483108201/) and [486556811/](486556811/).

Helper & common files, e.g. NMODL channel descriptions are in [NEURON/](NEURON/).

To download the original data using the Allen SDK try:

    python download.py

### NeuroML 2 models of biophysically detailed cells

NeuroML2 versions of the cell models which are constrained by the data 
collected in the Cell Types Database can be found [here](NeuroML2).

To extract these from the original NEURON files try:

    nrnivmodl  NEURON    # Compile the Neuron mod files in the NEURON folder
    python ParseAll.py

### GLIF models

Conversion of Allen Cell Types Database GLIF models to NeuroML 2/LEMS can be found [here](GLIF/).
